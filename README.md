# Exploring the Cyber Dimension of War in Ukraine: Key Lessons for the EU

## Overview

This repository contains the research materials and code for the dissertation project titled "Cyber Defence Dynamics: Russia-Ukraine War and the European Union." The project investigates the intricate dynamics of cyber defence in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with a specific focus on the European Union's cybersecurity framework.

## Abstract

In the evolving landscape of global security, the intersection of technology, warfare, and international relations is reshaping geopolitical dynamics. This dissertation employs a multidisciplinary framework encompassing international relations, cybersecurity, European law, and programming languages for data analysis. Using a mixed-method approach involving qualitative and quantitative analyses, the research aims to uncover the complex landscape of cyber-related phenomena.

Guided by theoretical concepts such as Complex Interdependence, Securitisation Theory, and Neo-Functionalism, the study provides a lens to interpret cyber power dynamics and evolving state interactions in the digital age. The first part delves into the cyber dimension of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, unraveling employed strategies and lessons learned. The second part shifts focus to the European Union and its members, conducting a comparative analysis of cybersecurity approaches in France, Estonia, Germany, and the Netherlands.

Insights from Russian cyber operations highlight the need for a resilient strategy in critical infrastructure defense and the challenges in investment for skill development and infrastructure enhancement. Notably, the EU emerges as a normative cyber power, influencing cyber capabilities among its Member States, acting as a catalyst in shaping ongoing cyber strategies within the civil sphere rather than the military domain.

The comparative analysis reveals diverse approaches in political initiatives, deterrence, economic measures, and the military domain. Challenges, including the skill gap and the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors, are underscored. However, the integration with military kinetic counterparts is yet to be substantially realized.
