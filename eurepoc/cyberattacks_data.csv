In addition to Ukraine, the disruption of satellite services of Viasat also affected other countries in Europe, including Germany (e.g., German wind turbines). While the Viasat network was ""stabilized"" by 15 March, an incident report was issued by Viasat on 30 March and stated that the company and its customers were still affected by the attack. The US authorities (CISA and FBI) issued a warning on 17 March to US critical infrastructure companies of satellite communications (SATCOM) risks and ""possible threats."" By 10 May the malicious attack was attributed to the Russian Federation. Sentinel Labs identified that the data wiping malware supposedly used in the Viasat attack was AcidRain, the cybersecurity researchers also attributed the malware to being developed by Russian intelligence agencies.

1779,Cyberattack on Portuguese military resulting in theft and doxing of NATO documents in 2022,"The Armed Forces General Staff agency of Portugal (EMGFA) allegedly suffered a prolonged and undetected cyberattack which resulted in NATO documents being stolen and sold on the dark web. The documents were discovered by American cyber-intelligence agents and notified US authorities at the US Embassy in Lisbon. The National Security Office (GNS) and Portugal’s national cybersecurity center immediately reacted to the threat by deploying a team of experts to EMGFA to investigate the defence agency's network. The stolen documents were acquired through specially programmed bots that probed the network and were trained to discover and detect precisely this type of information. The leak of the documents is of “extreme gravity” and might impact the NATO alliance by creating distrust between members. The EMGFA computers are air-gapped and the data was exfiltrated via standard non-scure lines. This mean that the first assumpt is that the military agency might have ""broken its operational security rules at some point."" No official statement has been released yet by Portuguese officials. However, members of parliament have requested the chairman of the parliamentary defense committee, Marcos Perestrello, to schedule hearings as soon as possible.

1813,Hacker group PLAY carried out a ransomware attack on the Belgian city of Antwerp on 6 December 2022,"Hacker group PLAY carried out a ransomware attack on the Belgian city of Antwerp on 6 December 2022, Het Laatste Nieuws reported first. 
The impact and nature of this ransomware attack remain unclear. HLN's initial media report on the morning of Dec. 6 states that the ransomware attack knocked out a variety of community services by hacking servers from IT service provider Digipolis from December 5 to December 6. 
On 6 December vice minister-president of the Flemish government and Flemish Minister for Living Together and Domestic Administration Bart Somers said that he ""now wants to release 1.25 million euros for emergency incidents such as these in Antwerp."" 
On December 11, the hacker group PLAY adds the city of Antwerp to its list of victims on its website. They claim to have stolen 557 gigabytes of data, this includes personal information, passports and more, and announce to publish this data on December 19 if the ransom demand is not paid. 
The following day, ITdaily reports that data from the city of Antwerp has been encrypted, disrupting a variety of municipal services such as libraries, museums, schools. 
On December 19 and before, the mayor of Antwerp Bart de Wever confirmed at a press conference that about 500 gigabytes of data had been stolen. However, he also says that the disruption of the city of Antwerp is not due to the hacker group, but to the city's security measures. The person in charge of the city of Antwerp even reveals that the stolen data is not personal information, as claimed by the hacker group, but login data and documents related to the city's personnel and construction projects.

1891,Iranian state-sponsored hacking group NEPTUNIUM is suspected of stealing personal information from Charlie Hebdo subscribers and defacing its website in January 2023,"The Iranian state-sponsored hacking group Neptunium stole the personal information of subscribers of the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo and defaced its website in January 2023, Microsoft's Digital Threat Analysis Center (DTAC) assesses with high confidence.
The operation traces back to December 2022, when Charlie Hebdo announced a cartoon contest featuring Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as the subject. 
On 4 January 2023, a user by the name Holy Souls claimed to have obtained the personal information of 230,000 Charlie Hebdo subscribers. Samples released togehter with the online post show the full names, phone numbers, financial information, as well as email and home addresses of individuals that Le Monde confirmed as actual subscribers of the magazine. The information could expose readers to harm, digitally and in the real world. News about both the defacement and alleged data theft were pushed in a concerted effort across social media platforms that matches with tactics Microsoft had observed for earlier Iranian-directed influence campaigns. 
Reports that the purported cache of customer details was obtained in a breach of the outlet's database are based on statements by Holy Souls that have not been independently or directly confirmed by Charlie Hebdo.
Microsoft identifies Neptunium as Emennet Pasargad, an Iranian cyber firm that was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in November 2021 over attempts to interfere in the 2020 US presidential elections. The company had previously been designated under the US sanctions regime in February 2019 as Net Peygard Samavat Company before later rebranding as Emennet Pasargad.",,2023-01-01,"Attack conducted by non-state group / non-state actor with political goals (religious, ethnic, etc. groups) / undefined actor with political goals","Attack conducted by a state-affiliated group (includes state-sanctioned, state-supported, state-controlled but officially non-state actors) (“cyber-proxies”) / a group that is generally attributed as state-affiliated ",Incident disclosed by attacker,Data theft; Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse,[['Charlie Hebdo']],['France'],"[['EUROPE', 'NATO', 'EU', 'WESTEU']]",[['Media']],,['NEPTUNIUM / Emennet Pasargad'],"['Iran, Islamic Republic of']","['Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested']",,1,2023-02-03 00:00:00,"Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",IT-security community attributes attacker,Microsoft,,United States,NEPTUNIUM / Emennet Pasargad,"Iran, Islamic Republic of","Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",,['https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/02/03/dtac-charlie-hebdo-hack-iran-neptunium/'],System / ideology,Unknown,,Unknown,,0,,,,,,No,,Not available,Data Exfiltration; Defacement,Not available,True,For private / commercial targets: sensitive information (incident scores 2 points in intensity),Short-term disruption (< 24h; incident scores 1 point in intensity),"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",none,none,5,Moderate - high political importance,5.0,Low,10.0,Day (< 24h),Major data breach/exfiltration (critical/sensitive information) & data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data ,1-10,1.0,,0.0,None,0.0,euro,Indirect (knowingly sanctioning / ordering / ideological / material support by official members of state entities/agencies/units for officially non-state-actors),Sovereignty,,Not available,0,,,,,,Not available,,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),,"['https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/02/03/dtac-charlie-hebdo-hack-iran-neptunium/', 'https://cyberscoop.com/iran-charlie-hebdo-hack/', 'https://www.jpost.com/international/article-730541', 'https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/iran-backed-actor-behind-cyberattack-charlie-hebdo-microsoft-says', 'https://twitter.com/iblametom/status/1621513502149206023', 'https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1621529797619752962', 'https://securityaffairs.com/141855/apt/charlie-hebdo-data-leak-iran.html', 'https://jyllands-posten.dk/international/ECE14953615/microsoft-iranere-stod-bag-hackerangreb-paa-charlie-hebdo/', 'https://twitter.com/securityaffairs/status/1622219319823241220', 'https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/medias/microsoft-affirme-que-liran-est-a-lorigine-de-la-cyberattaque-contre-charlie-hebdo-1903746', 'https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/microsoft-iranian-nation-state-group.html', 'https://twitter.com/asfakian/status/1622555787158605826', 'https://twitter.com/fr0gger_/status/1622475455805935621', 'https://twitter.com/unix_root/status/1622636487169671169', 'https://twitter.com/780thC/status/1622584638144147457', 'https://www.lemonde.fr/lmdgft/1/NjE1NjkxNi1mZjNlZmMwMGQ1NGUyMWVlMTBmYzRmZjBjZjAzYjU2YzNkY2JkM2NlYjNhZjIwZTg2ZGIwMTJlYThjODA0OWE3?random=1150217085', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20230109230217/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKRnCjbMqEM', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20230109230105/https://breached.vc/Thread-Personal-information-of-230000-customers-of-charliehebdo-fr', 'https://twitter.com/CERTEU/status/1631572192667353089']"

1925,Anonymous Sudan disrupted the website of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and leaked customer information on 14 February 2023,"Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) was hacked and its website taken offline by a group referring to itself as Anonymous Sudan. Customers attempting to log in into the airline's app were redirected and shown information from accounts of other passengers. The incident follows a Quran buring by a far-right politician near the Turkish embassy in Stockholm during a protest in January that was funded by a former contributor to the Russian state-funded outlet RT. Anonymous Sudan has since claimed to have conducted a series of denial-of-service attacks against a variety of organizations in Sweden, citing retaliation for the book burning as its motivation. Targets have included the websites of Swedish airports, banks, railways, airlines, media, telecommunication providers, and organizations in the country's health and education sectors. These alleged attempts do not appear to have caused any significant downtime. 
Anonymous Sudan also took responsibility for knocking Sweden's national broadcaster SVT offline on 14 February, around the same time as the attack against SAS.
Marcus Murray, founder of the Swedish cybersecurity firm Trusec, cautioned Anonymous Sudan may be a front for Russian operators, noting that the Quran burning may be an opportunity for Moscow to instigate tension between Sweden and Turkey to hobble Sweden's bid to join NATO.
